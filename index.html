<h3>Flowers aid relaxation</h3>
<p>The act of tending to flowers and plants can be relaxing, and gardening can specifically be a healthy way to work through stress or frustration. Also, the scent of flowers is known to aid relaxation, thus sachets and bath products are often floral. (Who doesn’t love a lavender-scented bath or candle?) Consider how often people visit a garden to relax. Though we may not understand the science behind it, it’s tough to deny that gardens aid in relaxation.

  <h3>Flowers improve memory.</h3>

  <h3>Flowers can help improve mood.
</h3>
<p>At the most basic level, receiving flowers from someone can help lift a mood because it means someone cares, and that is always impactful. But even if the flowers are bought or planted and enjoyed by the same person, they can help improve mood because they look nice and smell good – two factors that are scientifically proven to provide an emotional boost. And an improved mood often leads to improved health</p>
